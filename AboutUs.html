            Problem statement

            No business can thrive without it’s customers. On the flip side, customers leaving the business is a nightmare that every business owner dreads!

            In fact, one of the key metrics to measure a business’ success is by measuring its customer churn rate - the lower the churn, the more loved the company is.

            Typically, every user of a product or a service is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value may be based on multiple factors such as the user’s demographic, their browsing behavior and historical purchase data, among other details.

            This value factors in unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer and is updated every day for all users who have purchased at least one of the products/services. The values assigned are between 1 and 5.

            Task

            An up-and-coming startup is keen on reducing its customer churn and has hired you as a Machine Learning engineer for this task. As an expert, you are required to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the churn score for a website based on multiple features.

            Dataset

            The dataset consists of parameters such as the user’s demographic and PII details, membership account details, duration and frequency of their visits to the website, reported grievances and feedback, and the like.

            The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

            This challenge encourages you to apply your Machine Learning skills to build a model that predicts a user’s churn score.
